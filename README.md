Маленький проект, статистическая модель посленулевого общества из книги Нил Стивенсон "Семиевие". Расчет вероятности сохранения 7ми независимых рас за 5000 лет после ноля.

Niel Stephenson "Seveneve" model for post-nul society. I wondered if it is statistically possible for intependent races to be preseved after 5000 years.
We start witn N_i purebloods for each race and than new generation start to be generated. Every person has 2*23 chromosomes. Every one is a 1-length vector in 7-space. I.e. if vector of chromosome is aligned with Aivian axis, the chromosome has 100% avian markers and nothing else. And so on. When person in concieved random chromosome is taken form each pair for each parent, some crossing-over happenes, and gender is determined by what chromosome was randomly selected for pair 0, which is considered XY pair and does not undergoes crossing-over. Now we can also calculate overall racial 7-vector of a person and also racial purity of a person. 1 means 7-vector is aligned with an axis (pureblood), 0 means 7-vector is an center axis of a hypercone, drawn through axes (person is equal parts of 7 races).
The partner is determined by a weighted random, where weight for a potential partner calculated as product of racial similarity between persons (dot product), overall racial importance parameter, and racial purity of each person. The idea is that more racially pure person is, more importance they assign to racial similarity when choosing partner. Hence mixed heritage people do not care of race of partner, but there is also a global paramter of how exactly unlikely interracial pairs of purebloods is.
In the end we get stats by deciles of racial purity in the overall popolation. 
Interface is in Russian.
